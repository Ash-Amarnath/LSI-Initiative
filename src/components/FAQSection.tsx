  { q: "What is LSI?", a: "LSI (Living Standards Initiative) is a student-led initiative that documents real living conditions across Indian villages — electricity, water, education, healthcare — to fill the gaps official data misses. Our India pilot is the first step toward global coverage." },
  { q: "Do I need prior experience to join?", a: "No. We provide full training. You need curiosity and access to a local area." },
  { q: "How much time does volunteering require?", a: "As little as 2-3 hours per week. Field visits are optional; you can contribute remotely." },
  { q: "Is LSI a registered organization?", a: "We are a student-led initiative. Registration as a formal organization is in progress." },
  { q: "How is the collected data used?", a: "Data is cleaned, verified, and published on our public map. It's never sold or shared with private entities." },
  { q: "What areas are you currently active in?", a: "We are in Stage 1, actively recruiting across India. Haryana, UP, and Rajasthan are our pilot zones." },
  { q: "Can institutions partner with LSI?", a: "Absolutely! Universities, NGOs, and government bodies can collaborate on data validation, expand our reach, or use our findings. Reach out via the Contact page." },
  { q: "What data do you collect exactly?", a: "Electricity availability, water sources, road access, distance to healthcare, school conditions, mobile network coverage, and more." },
